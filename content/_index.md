description: I am a postdoctoral research fellow at the [Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/) in the Department of [Social and Behavioral Sciences](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/social-and-behavioral-sciences/). My work centers on applying <span style="font-family:Metropolis-SB">causal inference, epidemiologic, and simulation-based methods</span> to improve health policies and programs, especially those that reduce <span style="font-family:Metropolis-SB">disparities</span> in food access, obesity, and cardiometabolic disease.</span>  I hold a PhD in Population Health Sciences and SM in Biostatistics from Harvard University, and an MS in Epidemiology and a BA in Public Health from the University of California Berkeley, and currently play oboe/English horn with the [Longwood Symphony Orchestra](http://longwoodsymphony.org/).
