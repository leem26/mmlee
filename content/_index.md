description: I am a third-year PhD student in the Population Health Sciences program at the [Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/) in the Department of [Nutrition](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutrition/). My work centers on applying methods from <span style="font-family:Metropolis-SB"> causal inference, epidemiology, and Bayesian statistics</span> to improve health policies and programs, especially those that reduce <span style="font-family:Metropolis-SB">disparities</span> in food access, obesity, and cardiometabolic disease.</span>  I hold an MS in Epidemiology and a BA in Public Health from [UC Berkeley](https://publichealth.berkeley.edu/), and currently play oboe/English horn with the [Longwood Symphony Orchestra](http://longwoodsymphony.org/) and the [GSAS Symphony Orchestra.](https://engage.gsas.harvard.edu/organization/gsasstudentcenterorchestra)
