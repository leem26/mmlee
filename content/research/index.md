My doctoral research aims to identify the <span style="font-family:Metropolis-SB">causal effects</span> of existing and potential nutrition policies on obesity and cardiometabolic disease risk factors, with the overall goal of reducing <span style="font-family:Metropolis-SB">health disparities</span> and improving <span style="font-family:Metropolis-SB">population health</span>. Using a diverse set of *causal inference, econometrics, and decision science* methods, I am working to understand how dietary behaviors such as the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) <u>propagate and spread through social networks</u>, how SSB tax-attributable beverage advertising changes <u>moderate treatment effects</u>, and how microsimulations of proposed policies aimed at reducing obesity <u>can more accurately reflect real-world implementation and target populations</u>. I am primarily advised by [Dr. Erica Kenney](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/erica-kenney/) in the Harvard T.H. Chan School [Department of Nutrition](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutrition/), and collaborate with others in [Health Policy and Management](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/health-policy-and-management/), [Epidemiology](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/epidemiology/), [Social and Behavioral Sciences](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/social-and-behavioral-sciences/), and [Biostatistics](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/biostatistics/), as well as with researchers at the [Prevention Research Center](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/prc/).
